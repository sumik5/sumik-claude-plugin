description: >-
  Microservices architectural patterns covering CQRS, Event Sourcing, 8 Saga pattern variants, distributed transactions, service granularity decisions, data ownership, workflow orchestration, and contract design.
  Use when designing microservices architecture, choosing transaction strategies, or deciding service granularity.
  Covers messaging, resilience, security, reuse, and data access patterns.
  For migration strategy and trade-off analysis methodology, use modernizing-architecture instead.
  For DDD domain modeling, use applying-domain-driven-design instead.
  For frontend decomposition patterns (micro-frontends), use architecting-micro-frontends instead.
  For green/sustainable microservices trade-offs and carbon-efficient architecture, use building-green-software instead.
  For data architecture patterns (read-side optimization, caching strategies), use architecting-data instead.
