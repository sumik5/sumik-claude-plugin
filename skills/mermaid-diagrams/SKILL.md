name: mermaid-diagrams
description: Comprehensive guide for creating 22+ diagram types using Mermaid syntax. Use when users need to visualize software architecture (class, sequence, flowchart, ERD, C4, block, architecture), document processes (state, gantt, timeline, kanban, user journey, gitgraph), or present data (pie, xy, quadrant, radar, sankey, treemap). Also includes specialized diagrams (ZenUML, packet) and advanced theming. Triggers include "diagram", "visualize", "model", "map out", "show the flow", or requests for architecture, database schemas, workflows, or data visualization. For data chart design principles (chart type selection, color scales, visualization best practices), use designing-data-visualizations instead.
