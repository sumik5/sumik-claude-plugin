name: understanding-database-internals
description: >-
  Comprehensive database internals reference covering storage engines (B-trees, LSM-trees,
  file formats, transactions, recovery) and distributed systems (failure detection, leader
  election, replication, consistency models, consensus algorithms).
  Use when designing database-backed systems, choosing storage engines, understanding
  consistency guarantees, or debugging distributed system behavior.
  For SQL-level antipatterns and query optimization, use avoiding-sql-antipatterns instead.
  For relational database design process (entity modeling, ER diagrams, normalization), use designing-relational-databases instead.
  For data architecture patterns (CQRS, event sourcing, caching strategies), use architecting-data instead.
  For GCP-specific data services (BigQuery, Dataflow, Dataproc), use developing-google-cloud instead.
