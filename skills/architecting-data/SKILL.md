name: architecting-data
description: >-
  Data architecture patterns covering read-side optimization (replicas, materialized views,
  CQRS, CDC, event sourcing), domain-based decomposition, polyglot persistence, and caching
  strategies (cache-aside, read-through, write-through, write-around).
  Use when designing data flow architecture, choosing read scalability strategies, or
  implementing caching for enterprise systems.
  For microservices patterns (Saga, granularity), use architecting-microservices instead.
  For DDD domain modeling, use applying-domain-driven-design instead.
  For database engine internals, use understanding-database-internals instead.
  For relational DB schema design, use designing-relational-databases instead.
  For GCP-specific data services (BigQuery, Dataflow, Dataproc), use developing-google-cloud instead.
