  For socio-technical architecture modernization and trade-off analysis, use modernizing-architecture instead.
  For microservices distributed patterns (Saga, messaging, granularity), use architecting-microservices instead.
  For data architecture read-side patterns and caching strategies, use architecting-data instead.
