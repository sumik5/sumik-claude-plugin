description: >-
  Comprehensive green software engineering guide covering carbon efficiency, energy efficiency,
  hardware efficiency, and carbon awareness. MUST load when designing systems with sustainability
  requirements or optimizing carbon footprint. Covers code efficiency patterns, operational
  efficiency, carbon-aware computing, green AI/ML, measurement methodologies, and the Green
  Software Maturity Matrix. For monitoring-specific patterns, use designing-monitoring instead.
  For microservices architecture decisions, use architecting-microservices instead.
