  React 19.x development guide covering internals (rendering, reconciliation, Fiber), performance optimization
  (47+ react-doctor rules, memoization, bundle size), UI animation patterns (CSS transitions, easing, hover/touch),
  and React Testing Library (RTL queries, interactions, TDD patterns).
  Use when package.json contains 'react' (without 'next'), or when working on React-specific concerns
  in any framework. For Next.js-specific features (App Router, Server Components, Cache Components),
  use developing-nextjs instead. For E2E testing with Playwright, use testing-e2e-with-playwright.
  For general testing methodology, use testing-code.
