## Common Issues

### Issue: Description Too Vague

```yaml
# Bad
description: Helps with documents

# Good
description: Extracts text and tables from PDF files. Use when working with PDFs or document extraction.
```

### Issue: Wrong Point of View

```yaml
# Bad
description: I can help you process Excel files

# Good
description: Processes Excel files and generates reports. Use when analyzing spreadsheets.
```

### Issue: Time-Sensitive Information

```markdown
# Bad
If you're doing this before August 2025, use the old API.

# Good
## Current Method
Use the v2 API endpoint.

## Legacy Method (Deprecated)
<details>
<summary>v1 API (deprecated)</summary>
The v1 API used different endpoints...
</details>
```

### Issue: Inconsistent Terminology

```markdown
# Bad - mixing terms
Use the "API endpoint" to...
Then call the "URL" with...
Access the "route" at...

# Good - consistent
Use the API endpoint to...
Then call the endpoint with...
Access the endpoint at...
```

### Issue: Deep File Nesting

```markdown
# Bad
SKILL.md → advanced.md → details.md → info.md

# Good
SKILL.md → advanced.md
SKILL.md → details.md
SKILL.md → info.md
```

### Issue: Too Many Options

````markdown
# Bad
You can use pypdf, or pdfplumber, or PyMuPDF, or pdf2image...

# Good
Use pdfplumber for text extraction:
```python
import pdfplumber
```

For scanned PDFs requiring OCR, use pdf2image with pytesseract.
````

## Quick Validation Commands

```bash
# Check SKILL.md line count
wc -l SKILL.md

# Check for time-sensitive patterns
grep -i "202[0-9]\|before\|after\|latest" SKILL.md

# Check for Windows paths
grep -r "\\\\" .

# Check name format
head -5 SKILL.md | grep "^name:"

# Check description format
head -10 SKILL.md | grep "^description:"
```

## Final Review Questions

Before sharing, ask yourself:

1. **Discoverability**: Will Claude find this skill when needed?
2. **Conciseness**: Is every line earning its place?
3. **Clarity**: Can Claude follow the instructions without confusion?
4. **Completeness**: Is anything critical missing?
5. **Testability**: Have I verified this works in practice?

If any answer is "no" or "unsure," iterate before sharing.
