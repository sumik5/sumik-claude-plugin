name: analyzing-software-tradeoffs
description: >-
  Comprehensive software design trade-off analysis covering code-level decisions
  (duplication, error handling, flexibility, optimization), API design (usability,
  versioning), distributed systems (consistency, delivery semantics), and meta-decisions
  (library selection, trend evaluation, date-time handling). Use when evaluating
  design alternatives, making architectural decisions, or reviewing trade-offs in
  existing systems. For specific clean code rules, use writing-clean-code; for
  microservices patterns, use architecting-microservices; for API endpoint design,
  use designing-web-apis.
