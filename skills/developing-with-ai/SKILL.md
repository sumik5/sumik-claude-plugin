description: >-
  AI-assisted development methodology covering prompt engineering,
  context engineering, code generation workflows, quality assurance, collaborative
  debugging, and agent collaboration patterns. MUST load when working with AI coding
  tools or discussing AI-assisted development practices. Use when crafting prompts
  for code generation, managing AI context, reviewing AI-generated code, or
  coordinating multi-agent development workflows. For AI copywriting techniques,
  use crafting-ai-copywriting instead. For testing-specific AI techniques (test data
  generation, exploratory testing with AI, test planning with AI), use testing-code
  AI references instead. For organizational AI development security strategy (trust
  frameworks, governance, AI-SPM), use securing-ai-development instead. For
  PM-specific Claude Code workflows (codebase investigation, feedback synthesis,
  competitive analysis, requirements generation), use using-claude-code-as-pm instead.
  For LLM application production operations, use practicing-llmops.
