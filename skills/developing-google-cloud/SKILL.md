  Google Cloud development guide covering Cloud Run (architecture, scaling, CI/CD),
  GCP security (IAM, VPC, KMS, DLP, SCC, Zero Trust, Chronicle), data engineering
  (BigQuery, Dataflow, data pipelines, governance), network engineering (VPC, load balancing,
  CDN, Traffic Director), and Memorystore (Redis/Memcached, cache patterns, resilience).
  MUST load when Dockerfile is detected with google-cloud packages, when cloudbuild.yaml is present,
  or when working with BigQuery, Dataflow, Dataproc, Cloud Interconnect, or Memorystore.
  For Docker-specific patterns, use managing-docker instead.
  For general monitoring design, use designing-monitoring instead.
  For code-level security (OWASP, CodeGuard), use securing-code instead.
  For data architecture patterns (CQRS, event sourcing), use architecting-data instead.
  For AWS development, use developing-aws instead.
  For serverless security (GCS hacking, Cloud Run abuse), use securing-serverless instead.
  For application logging, use implementing-logging.
