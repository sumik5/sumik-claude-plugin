description: >-
  Socio-technical architecture modernization covering strategy, domain design, team organization, and trade-off analysis methodology.
  Use when modernizing legacy systems, redesigning domain boundaries, planning migration strategies, or building custom trade-off analysis frameworks.
  Differs from writing-clean-code (code-level) by focusing on system-level decisions.
  For microservices patterns (Saga, granularity), use architecting-microservices instead.
  For DDD domain modeling, use applying-domain-driven-design instead.
  For micro-frontend architecture patterns, use architecting-micro-frontends instead.
  For comprehensive trade-off analysis across code/API/system levels, use analyzing-software-tradeoffs.
