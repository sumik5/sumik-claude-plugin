name: designing-monitoring
description: >
  Designs monitoring and observability systems covering anti-patterns, design patterns,
  layer-based strategy (6 layers),
  alerting, on-call operations, incident management, telemetry pipeline architecture,
  observability concepts (structured events, core analysis loop), SLO-based reliability,
  sampling strategies, and observability maturity model.
  Use when designing monitoring strategy, setting up alerting, choosing monitoring tools,
  building observability systems, implementing SLOs, or adopting observability practices.
  For OpenTelemetry SDK/API implementation, use implementing-opentelemetry instead.
  For green software carbon metrics and sustainability monitoring, use building-green-software instead.
  For Google Cloud monitoring (Cloud Logging, Security Command Center, Cloud Run), use developing-google-cloud instead.
  For LLM-specific evaluation and monitoring, use practicing-llmops.
  For application logging design, structured logging, and log collection pipelines, use implementing-logging instead.
